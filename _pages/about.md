Hello and welcome to my page! After spending my early career in various civil engineering (CE) fields, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. to better understand how robotics and machine learning can be best applied to CE applications. To this end, my Ph.D. goals lie in developing theory and algorithms for *Certifiably Correct SLAM* and *Optimal Experimental Design* while rooting their application in CE, particularly in marine and post-disaster settings. Upon graduation, I plan on applying my technical skills and knowledge in industry, where I aim to continue R&D work in the area of robotic perception. If you are interested in the work I do, please reach out!
