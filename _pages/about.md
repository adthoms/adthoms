Hello and welcome to my page! After spending my early career in various civil engineering (CE) fields, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Computational Robotics and Data Science to better understand how robotics and machine learning can be best applied to CE applications. To this end, my Ph.D. goals lie in developing theory and algorithms for *Certifiably Correct SLAM* and *Optimal Experimental Design* to better understand the underlying structural conditions of buildings post-earthquake. If you are interested in the work I do, please reach out!
